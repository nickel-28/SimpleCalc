I've used Dart & Flutter while creating this Calculator app. As of now this app performs simple operations like "Addition", "Subtraction", "Multiplication" & "Division".
<br>
With time I will try to implement various mathemtical functions like sine, cosine, logarithmic, exponential etc to enhance the application of this app

Pull requests are open for the app
